                              <h3 class="text-header">What Is HIV?</h3>
                              <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.

                                   <br><br>
                                   
                                   If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (<i>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</i>).

                                   <br><br>

                                   The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.
                                   Luckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a person’s viral load is so low that a standard lab can’t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   
                                   <br><br>

                                   In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. Learn about other ways to prevent getting or transmitting HIV.

                              <p>
                                   Treatment as Prevention (TasP) refers to taking HIV medicine to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. It is one of the most highly effective options for preventing HIV transmission.
                                   <br></br>
                                   People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load—a very low level of HIV in the blood—can live long and healthy lives and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex. This is sometimes called undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
                                   <br></br>
                                   TasP works when a person with HIV takes HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and has regular follow-up care, including routine viral load tests to ensure their viral load stays undetectable.

                                   CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. People should get tested more often when they have had more than one sex partner or are having sex with someone whose sexual history they don’t know. Some sexually active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).

                                   If your last HIV test result was negative, the test was more than one year ago, and you can answer yes to any of the following questions, then you should get an HIV test as soon as possible:

                                             Have you had sex with someone who could answer "yes" to any of the above questions or someone whose sexual history you don't know?
                                        </li>

                                   <p>
                                        If you are over 64 years of age and at risk for HIV, your health care provider may recommend HIV testing.
                                   
                                        Are you pregnant or trying to get pregnant? As part of proactive prenatal care, all pregnant women should receive certain blood tests to detect infections and other illnesses, such as HIV, syphilis, and Hepatitis B. Talk to a health care provider about these tests.
                                        
                                        Also, anyone who has been sexually assaulted or has had a high-risk exposure to HIV should consider taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and getting an HIV antigen test that can detect infection sooner than standard antibody testing. PEP may prevent HIV infection after possible exposure to HIV if it is started as soon as possible within 3 days after exposure to HIV.

                                   If you have a positive HIV test result, your HIV testing site will often link you to HIV care right after diagnosis so you can get started on treatment right away. That’s because starting treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as soon as possible is the best thing you can do to stay healthy. HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in your blood to an undetectable level—a level so low that a lab test can’t detect it. People with HIV who take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong> (This is often called undetectable = untransmittable or U=U). Treatment with HIV medicine is recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of how long you’ve had the virus or how healthy you are.

                                   HIV treatment is a lifelong commitment to your health and well-being. People who are newly diagnosed with HIV sometimes find it overwhelming. But HIV is a manageable disease and people with HIV are living longer now compared to when HIV was first discovered. People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>stay healthy</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.</strong> An undetectable viral load is a level of HIV in your blood so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. Most people can get the virus under control within 6 months of starting treatment.

                              <p>
                                   Part of keeping the virus in check and staying healthy is seeing your HIV health care provider regularly—usually a couple of times a year, depending on your health.

                                   At your HIV medical care appointments, your provider will run blood tests to monitor your HIV infection and make sure your HIV medication is working properly. Your provider will also treat you for other health concerns you may have and help connect you to resources to help you with other issues that could affect your ability to stick to your HIV treatment plan.

                              <h3>How Can You Make the Most of Your Medical Care?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV care and treatment is most successful when you actively take part. That means taking your HIV medications as prescribed, keeping your medical appointments, communicating honestly with your health care provider, and seeking more information from accurate and reliable sources. However, health care providers know that taking HIV medication as prescribed and seeing a HIV health care provider regularly can be difficult for some people. For example, some people may experience side effects from medication. Others may have trouble taking their medication on time given a busy work schedule. If you’re having trouble taking your HIV medicine and staying in medical care, talk to your provider right away. Together you can identify the reasons and make a plan to address them.

                                   You can find the support and assistance you need. For example, you might find it useful to join a support group with other people with HIV. Or your HIV care team might be able to connect you to a peer navigator who has been down this road and can share lessons and perspectives that might be helpful. Many HIV care teams also offer case management services to help connect you to other supportive services that can help you overcome obstacles to continuing your regular HIV medical care.

                                   Taking the steps that are necessary for you to get control over the virus will make it easier for you to put more time and energy toward the other parts of your life. Once you find a strategy that works for you, HIV can become a routine part of your life. If unexpected things happen that make it harder to manage life with HIV again, step back and think about what has changed. Don’t be too hard on yourself and give up. Get support from your health care provider, your behavioral health counselor, if you have one, and others. Think about some of the obstacles that you have already overcome and remind yourself of your strengths and abilities.

                              <p>
                                   Today, thanks to improvements in the effectiveness of treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), people with HIV who are diagnosed early and who get and stay on ART can keep the virus suppressed and live long and healthy lives. For this reason, more than half of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States and 6 territories and freely associated states are aged 50 and older. Many of them have been living with HIV for many years; others were diagnosed with HIV later in life.
                                   <br></br>
                                   That’s a significant change from the early years of the epidemic when people who were diagnosed with HIV or AIDS could expect to live only 1-2 years after their diagnosis since effective treatments were not yet available. This meant that the issues of aging were not a major focus for people with HIV disease.
                                   <br></br>
                                   According to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), of the nearly 1.1 million people living with diagnosed HIV in the United States in 2022, approximately 54% (596,044) were aged 50 and up. In addition, people aged 50 and older accounted for approximately 16% of the 38,043 new HIV diagnoses in 2022 among people ages 13 and older in the United States and six territories and associated states. In 2022, compared with 2018, rates of HIV diagnoses among persons ages 45-54 and 65-74 were decreasing, and among persons 55-64 and ≥75 were stable.
                                   <br></br>
                                   Further, in 2022, people over age 50 with HIV made up nearly half of the over half a million clients served by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP). In addition, in 2022, 93% of clients aged 50 and older receiving RWHAP HIV medical care were virally suppressed, which was higher than the national RWHAP average (89.7%).
