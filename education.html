                              <h3 class="text-header" id="about-hiv">What Is HIV?</h3>
                              <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.

                                   <br><br>
                                   
                                   If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (<i>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</i>).

                                   <br><br>

                                   The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.
                                   Luckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a person’s viral load is so low that a standard lab can’t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   
                                   <br><br>

                                   In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. Learn about other ways to prevent getting or transmitting HIV.
                              </p>

                              <h3>What Is AIDS?</h3>
                              <p>AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.

                                   <br><br>

                                   In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking HIV medicine as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.
                                   <br><br>
                                   A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             the number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) OR
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             they develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>
                                   <p>
                                        Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start HIV medicine soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that's why HIV testing is so important.
                                   </p>

                              <h3>How Do I Know If I Have HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   <strong>The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested.</strong> Testing is relatively simple. You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too. If you test positive, you can be connected to HIV care to start treatment as soon as possible. If you test negative, you have the information you need to take steps to prevent getting HIV in the future.
                                   <br><br>
                                   To find an HIV testing location near you, use the HIV Services Locator.
                                   <br><br>
                                   <strong>HIV self-testing is also an option.</strong> Self-testing allows people to take an HIV test and find out their result in their own home or other private location. With an HIV self-test, you can get your test results within 20 minutes. You can buy an HIV self-test kit at a pharmacy or online. Some health departments or community-based organizations also provide HIV self-test kits for a reduced cost or for free. You can call your local health department or use the HIV Testing and Care Services Locator to find organizations that offer HIV self-test kits near you. (Contact the organization for eligibility requirements.)
                              </p>

                              <h3 id="hiv-transmission">How Do You Get or Transmit HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   You can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV who has a detectable viral load. These fluids are:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>Blood</li>
                                        <li>Semen (cum) and pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum)</li>
                                        <li>Rectal fluids</li>
                                        <li>Vaginal fluids</li>
                                        <li>Breast milk</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>
                                   <p>
                                        For transmission to occur, the HIV in these fluids must get into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through a mucous membrane (found in the rectum, vagina, mouth, or tip of the penis), through open cuts or sores, or by direct injection (from a needle or syringe).
                                        <br><br>
                                        People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   </p>                                   
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Is HIV Spread from Person to Person?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV can only be spread through specific activities. In the United States, the most common ways are:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Does HIV Viral Load Affect Getting or Transmitting HIV?</strong> without using a condom the right way every time or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex for HIV transmission. Learn more about the HIV risk associated with specific sexual activities.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Sharing injection drug equipment, such as needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (“works”)</strong> with someone who has HIV because these items may have blood in them, and blood can carry HIV. People who inject hormones, silicone, or steroids can also get or transmit HIV by sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment. Learn more about HIV and injection drug use.
                                        </li>

                                   <p>Less common ways are:</p>
                                   <ul>

                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Being exposed to HIV through a needlestick or sharps injury.</strong> This is a risk mainly for health care workers. The risk is very low.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>

                                             <strong>Having oral sex.</strong> Oral sex carries little to no risk for getting or transmitting HIV. Theoretically, it is possible if an HIV-positive man ejaculates in his partner’s mouth during oral sex. Factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV through oral sex are oral ulcers, bleeding gums, genital sores, and the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which may or may not be visible. However, the risk is still extremely low, and much lower than with anal or vaginal sex.

                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV.</strong> The risk is extremely small these days because of rigorous testing of the U.S. blood supply and donated organs and tissues. (And you can’t get HIV from donating blood. Blood collection procedures are highly regular and very safe.)

                                             <strong>Being bitten by a person with HIV.</strong> Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. This rare transmission can occur through contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and blood or body fluids from a person who has HIV. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. There are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted through spitting as HIV is not transmitted through saliva.

HIV transmission can occur when the blood from an HIV-positive caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing and an infant eats it. However,  you can’t get HIV by consuming food handled by someone with HIV.

                              <h3>Does HIV Viral Load Affect Getting or Transmitting HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Yes. Viral load is the amount of HIV in the blood of someone who has HIV. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) can reduce a person's HIV viral load very low level, which keeps the immune system working and prevents illness. This is called <strong>viral suppression</strong>, defined as having less than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood.
                                   <br><br>
                                   HIV medicine can also make the viral load so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. This is called having an <strong>undetectable level viral load.</strong> Almost everyone who takes HIV medicine as prescribed can achieve an undetectable viral load, usually within 6 months after starting treatment.
                                   <br><br>
                                   As noted above, people with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   <br><br>
                                   HIV medicine is a powerful tool for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. But it works only if the HIV-positive partner gets and keeps an undetectable viral load. Not everyone taking HIV medicine has an undetectable viral load. To stay undetectable, people with HIV must take HIV medicine as prescribed and visit their health care provider regularly to get a viral load test.

                              <p>
                                   You can’t “catch” AIDS, which stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
                                   <br><br>
                                   AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV infection. If a person has HIV and is not on HIV treatment, the virus will weaken the body’s immune system and the person will progress to AIDS.
                                   <br><br>
                                   People with AIDS have such badly damaged immune systems that they get a number of severe illnesses, called opportunistic infections.
                                   <br><br>
                                   However, thanks to today’s effective HIV treatment, most people with HIV in the U.S. do not have AIDS. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can stay healthy and will not progress to AIDS.

                              <h3 id="hiv-risk">Is the Risk of HIV Different for Different Groups?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, gender, age, or where they live. However, certain groups of people in the United States are more likely to get HIV than others because of particular factors, including the communities in which they live, what subpopulations they belong to, and their risk behaviors.
                                   <br><br>
                                   <strong>Communities</strong>. When you live in a community where many people have HIV, the chance of being exposed to the virus by having sex or sharing needles or other injection equipment with someone who has HIV is higher. You can use CDC’s HIV, STD, hepatitis, and tuberculosis Atlas Plus to see the percentage of people with HIV (“prevalence”) in different U.S. counties and states, as well as other data. Within any community, the prevalence of HIV can vary among different subpopulations.
                                   <br><br>
                                   <strong>Subpopulations.</strong> In the United States, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men are the population most affected by HIV. According to CDC, of the 30,635 new HIV diagnoses in the U.S. in 2020, 68% (20,758) were among gay and bisexual men.a By race/ethnicity, Blacks/African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are disproportionately affected by HIV compared to other racial and ethnic groups. People who inject drugs remain at significant risk for getting HIV as well.
                                   <br><br>
                                   <strong>Risk behaviors.</strong> In the United States, HIV is spread mainly through having anal or vaginal sex or sharing needles or syringes with an HIV-positive partner. Anal sex is the highest-risk behavior. Fortunately, there are more HIV prevention tools available today than ever before. These include using condoms correctly, every time you have sex; pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use; and treatment as prevention, a method in which people with HIV take HIV medicine as prescribed to achieve and maintain an undetectable viral load, a level of HIV in the blood so low that it can’t be detected in a standard blood test. People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>

                                        <p>
                                             These symptoms can last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. But some people do not have any symptoms at all during this early stage of HIV.

                                             Don’t assume you have HIV just because you have any of these symptoms—they can be similar to those caused by other illnesses. <strong>But if you think you may have been exposed to HIV, get an HIV test.</strong>

                                             Here’s what to do:

                                             <ul>
                                                  <li>
                                                       <strong>Find an HIV testing site near you</strong>—You can get an HIV test at your primary care provider’s office, your local health department, a health clinic, or many other places. Use the HIV Services Locator to find an HIV testing site near you.
                                                  </li>
                                                  <li>
                                                       <strong>Request an HIV test for recent infection</strong>—Most HIV tests detect antibodies (proteins your body makes as a reaction to HIV), not HIV itself. But it can take a few weeks after you have HIV for your body to produce these antibodies. There are other types of tests that can detect HIV infection sooner. Tell your doctor or clinic if you think you were recently exposed to HIV and ask if their tests can detect early infection.
                                                  </li>
                                                  <li>
                                                       <strong>Know your status</strong>—After you get tested, be sure to learn your test results. If you’re HIV-positive, see a health care provider as soon as possible so you can start treatment with HIV medicine. <strong>And be aware: when you are in the early stage of infection, you are at very high risk of transmitting HIV to others.</strong> It is important to take steps to reduce your risk of transmission. If you are HIV-negative, there are prevention tools like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) that can help you stay negative.
                                                  </li>
                                             </ul>

                                             <h4>Stage 2: Clinical Latency</h4>
                                             <p>
                                                  In this stage, the virus still multiplies, but at very low levels. People in this stage may not feel sick or have any symptoms. This stage is also called <strong>chronic HIV infection.</strong>
                                                  <br></br>
                                                  Without HIV treatment, people can stay in this stage for 10 or 15 years, but some move through this stage faster.
                                                  <br></br>
                                                  If you take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you can <strong>live and long and healthy life</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to your HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                                  <br></br>
                                                  But if your viral load is detectable, you can transmit HIV during this stage, even when you have no symptoms. It’s important to see your health care provider regularly to get your viral load checked.
                                             </p>

                                             <h4>Stage 3: AIDS</h4>
                                             <p>
                                                  If you have HIV and you are not on HIV treatment, eventually the virus will weaken your body’s immune system and you will progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome).
                                                  <br><br>
                                                  This is the late stage of HIV infection.
                                                  <br><br>
                                                  Symptoms of AIDS can include:
                                                  <ul>
                                                       <li>Rapid weight loss</li>
                                                       <li>Recurring fever or profuse night sweats</li>

                                                       <li>Diarrhea that lasts for more than a week</li>
                                                       <li>Sores of the mouth, anus, or genitals</li>
                                                       <li>Pneumonia</li>
                                                       <li>Red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids</li>
                                                       <li>Memory loss, depression, and other neurologic disorders</li>
                                                  </ul>
                                                  <br>
                                                  <p>
                                                       Each of these symptoms can also be related to other illnesses. The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. If you are HIV-positive, a health care provider will diagnose if your HIV has progressed to stage 3 (AIDS) based on certain medical criteria.
                                                       <br><br>
                                                       Many of the severe symptoms and illnesses of HIV disease come from the opportunistic infections that occur because your body’s immune system has been damaged. See your health care provider if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.
                                                       <br><br>
                                                       But be aware: Thanks to effective treatment, most people in the U.S. with HIV do not progress to AIDS. If you have HIV and remain in care, take HIV medicine as prescribed, and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you will stay healthy and will not progress to AIDS.

                              <p>
                                   Treatment as Prevention (TasP) refers to taking HIV medicine to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. It is one of the most highly effective options for preventing HIV transmission.
                                   <br></br>
                                   People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load—a very low level of HIV in the blood—can live long and healthy lives and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex. This is sometimes called undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
                                   <br></br>
                                   TasP works when a person with HIV takes HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and has regular follow-up care, including routine viral load tests to ensure their viral load stays undetectable.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Taking HIV Medicine to Stay Healthy and Prevent Transmission</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV treatment involves taking highly effective medicine that reduces the amount of HIV in your body. HIV medicine is recommended for everyone with HIV, and people with HIV should start HIV medicine as soon as possible after diagnosis, even on that same day.
                                   <br></br>
                                   People on HIV treatment take a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV treatment regimen). A person's initial HIV treatment regimen generally includes three HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes that must be taken every day. Many people with HIV take two or more different HIV medicines combined in one pill. Long-acting injections of HIV medicine, given every two months, are also available if your health care provider determines that you meet certain requirements.
                                   <br></br>
                                   If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine reduces the amount of HIV in your blood (also called your viral load) to a very low level, which keeps your immune system working and prevents illness. This is called viral suppression, defined as 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood.
                                   <br></br>
                                   HIV medicine can also make your viral load so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. This is called having an undetectable viral load. Almost everyone who takes HIV medicine as prescribed can achieve an undetectable viral load, usually within 6 months after starting treatment. Many will bring their viral load to an undetectable level very quickly, but it could take more time for a small portion of people just starting HIV medicine.
                                   <br></br>
                                   There are important health benefits to getting the viral load as low as possible. People with HIV who know their status, take HIV medicine as prescribed, and get and keep an undetectable viral load can live long and healthy lives.
                                   <br></br>
                                   There is also a major prevention benefit. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.

                              <h3>Keep Your Viral Load Undetectable</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV treatment is not a cure and HIV is still in your body, even when your viral load is undetectable, so you need to keep taking your HIV medicine as prescribed. If you skip doses of your HIV medicine, even now and then, you give HIV the chance to multiply rapidly. This could weaken your immune system, and you could become sick.
                                   <br><br>
                                   If you have stopped taking your HIV medicine or are having trouble taking all the doses as prescribed, talk to your health care provider as soon as possible. Your provider can help you get back on track and discuss the best strategies to prevent transmitting HIV to your sexual partners until your viral load is confirmed to be undetectable again.
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Do We Know Treatment as Prevention Works?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Large research studies with newer HIV medicines have shown that treatment is prevention. Over several years, these studies monitored thousands of male-female and male-male couples in which one partner has HIV and the other does not. No HIV transmissions were observed when the HIV-positive partner was virally suppressed. This means that if you keep your viral load undetectable, you will not transmit HIV to someone you have vaginal, anal, or oral sex with.
                                   <br><br>
                                   In addition to preventing sexual transmission of HIV, studies have shown that there are other prevention benefits of taking HIV medicine to get and keep an undetectable viral load:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             It reduces the risk of HIV transmission to the child during pregnancy, labor, and delivery. If a pregnant person takes HIV medicine daily as prescribed throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery and gives HIV medicine to the infant for 4-6 weeks after giving birth, the risk of transmitting HIV to the baby can be 1% or less.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             It substantially reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of transmitting HIV through breastfeeding. The current recommendation in the United States is that mothers with HIV should not breastfeed their infants. 
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             It may reduce HIV transmission risk for people who inject drugs. Scientists do not have enough data to know whether having a suppressed or undetectable viral load prevents HIV transmission through sharing needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment (for example, cookers). It very likely reduces risk, but it’s unknown by how much. Even if you are taking HIV medicine and have an undetectable viral load, use new equipment each time you inject and do not share needles and syringes with other people.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>
                              </p>
                              
                              <h3>Talk with Your Health Care Provider about Getting to Undetectable</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Talk with your health care provider about the benefits of HIV treatment and which HIV medicine is right for you. Discuss how frequently you should get your viral load tested to make sure you get and keep an undetectable viral load. If your lab results show that the virus is detectable or if you are having trouble taking every dose of your medicine, you can still protect your HIV-negative partner by using other methods of preventing sexual transmission of HIV such as condoms, safer sex practices, and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for an HIV-negative partner until your viral load is undetectable again. Talk to your partner about post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) if you think they may have had a possible exposure to HIV (for example, if the condom breaks during sex and you don’t have an undetectable viral load).
                                   <br><br>
                                   Taking HIV medicine to maintain an undetectable viral load does not protect you or your partner from getting other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so talk to your provider about ways to prevent other STIs.

                                   TasP can be used alone or in conjunction with other prevention strategies. Talk about your HIV status with your sexual partners and decide together which prevention methods to use. Some states have laws that require you to tell your sexual partner that you have HIV in certain circumstances.

                              <h3 id="hiv-prep">What is PrEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use. PrEP can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Currently, there are two FDA-approved daily oral medications for PrEP. A long-acting injectable form of PrEP has also been approved by the FDA.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Why Take PrEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when taken as indicated.
                                   <br><br>
                                   PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99% when taken as prescribed. Among people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk by at least 74% when taken as prescribed. PrEP is much less effective when it isn't taken consistently.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Is PrEP Right for You?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PrEP may benefit you if you test negative for HIV and any of the following apply to you:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>you have had anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months, and you:</li>
                                        <li>have a sexual partner with HIV (especially if the partner has an unknown or detectable viral load), or</li>
                                        <li>have not consistently used a condom, or</li>
                                        <li>have been diagnosed with an STD in the past 6 months.</li>
                                   </ul>

                                   <p>Or</p>

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>you inject drugs and</li>
                                        <li>have an injection partner with HIV, or</li>
                                        <li>share needles, syringes, or other injection equipment.</li>
                                   </ul>

                                   <p>
                                        You may choose to take PrEP even if the behaviors above don’t apply to you. Talk to your health care provider.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If you have a partner with HIV and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your doctor about PrEP. PrEP may be an option to help protect you and your baby from getting HIV while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.
                                   </p>
                              </p>

                              <h3>What Drugs Are Approved for PrEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PrEP can be pills or shots.
                                   <br><br>
                                   There are two pills approved for daily use as PrEP. They are combinations of two anti-HIV drugs in a single pill:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>Truvada® (<i>emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</i>) is for all people at risk for HIV through sex or injection drug use. Generic versionsExit are also available.</li>
                                        <li>Descovy® (<i>emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide</i>) is for sexually active men at risk of getting HIV. Descovy® is not for women who are at risk for HIV through receptive vaginal sex.</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <p>A long-acting injectable form of PrEP has also been approved by the FDA:</p>

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>Apretude® (<i>cabotegravir</i>) is for people at risk for HIV through sex who weigh at least 77 pounds (35 kg). It’s an injection given by your health care provider every other month instead of daily oral pills.</li>
                                   </ul>
                              </p>

                              <h3>Is PrEp Safe?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PrEP is safe. No significant health effects have been seen in people who are HIV-negative and have taken PrEP for up to 5 years.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Some people taking PrEP may have side effects, like nausea, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and stomach pain. These side effects are usually not serious and go away over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your health care provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.
                                   <br><br>
                                   And be aware: PrEP protects you against HIV but not against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or other types of infections. Combining PrEP with condoms will reduce your risk of getting other STIs.
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Do You Get PrEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   If you think PrEP may be right for you, visit your doctor or health care provider. PrEP is only available by prescription. Any health care provider licensed to write prescriptions can prescribe PrEP; specialization in infectious diseases or HIV medicine is not required.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Because PrEP is for people who are HIV-negative, you’ll have to get an HIV test before starting PrEP and you may need to get other tests to make sure it’s safe for you to use PrEP.
                                   <br><br>
                                   If you take daily oral PrEP, you’ll need to see a health care provider every 3 months for repeat HIV tests, prescription refills, and follow-up. If you use injectable PrEP, you’ll need to see a healthcare provider every two months for an HIV test and the injections.
                              </p>

                              <h3 id="hiv-post">What Is PEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV PEP, or post-exposure prophylaxis, is a short course of HIV medicines taken very soon after a possible exposure to HIV to prevent the virus from taking hold in your body.
                                   <br><br>
                                   You must start it within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV, or it won’t work. Every hour counts!
                                   <br><br>
                                   PEP should be used only in emergency situations. It is not meant for regular use by people who may be exposed to HIV frequently.
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Do You Know If You Need PEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PEP may be right for you if you are HIV-negative or don’t know your HIV status, and you think you may have been exposed to HIV in the last 72 hours:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>During sex (for example, you had a condom break with a partner of unknown HIV status or a partner with HIV who is not virally suppressed)</li>
                                        <li>Through shared needles, syringes, or other equipment used to inject drugs (for example, cookers)</li>
                                        <li>Through sexual assault</li>
                                        <li>Through a possible workplace exposure, such as from needlestick injury. Workplace HIV transmission is extremely rare.</li>
                                   </ul>
                              </p>

                              <h3>Where Can You Get PEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   If you think you were recently exposed to HIV, contact a health care provider immediately or go to an emergency room or urgent care clinic right away.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Your health care provider, an urgent care provider, or emergency room doctor will evaluate you, help you decide whether PEP is right for you, and work with you to determine which medicines to take for PEP.
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Long Do You Need to Take PEP?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   If you are prescribed PEP, you will need to take the HIV medicines every day for 28 days. It is important to take all the doses as prescribed to give PEP the best chance of working.
                                   <br><br>
                                   You will also need to return to your health care provider at certain times while taking PEP and after you finish taking it for follow-up HIV testing at 4 to 6 weeks and at 3 months and for other lab tests.
                              </p>
                              
                              <h3>How Well Does PEP Work?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PEP is effective in preventing HIV infection when it’s taken correctly, but it’s not 100% effective. The sooner you start PEP after a possible HIV exposure, the better.
                                   <br><br>
                                   While taking PEP, it’s important to use other HIV prevention methods, such as using condoms the right way, every time you have sex and using only new, sterile needles and works when injecting drugs.
                              </p>

                              <h3>Does PEP Cause Side Effects?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   PEP is safe, but the HIV medicines used for PEP may cause side effects like nausea in some people. In almost all cases, these side effects can be treated and aren’t life-threatening.
                                   <br><br>
                                   If you are taking PEP, talk to your health care provider if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.
                                   <br><br>
                                   PEP medicines may also interact with other medicines that a person is taking (called a drug interaction). For this reason, it’s important to tell your health care provider about any other medicines that you take, including over the counter medications, street drugs, and alcohol.

                              <p>
                                   CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. People should get tested more often when they have had more than one sex partner or are having sex with someone whose sexual history they don’t know. Some sexually active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).
                                   <br></br>
                                   If your last HIV test result was negative, the test was more than one year ago, and you can answer yes to any of the following questions, then you should get an HIV test as soon as possible:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>

                                        <li>
                                             Have you had sex—anal or vaginal—with a partner who has HIV?

                                        <li>
                                             Have you had more than one sex partner since your last HIV test?
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             Have you injected drugs and shared needles, syringes, or other injection drug equipment (for example, cookers) with others?
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             Have you exchanged sex for drugs or money?

                                        If you are over 64 years of age and at risk for HIV, your health care provider may recommend HIV testing.
                                   
                                        Are you pregnant or trying to get pregnant? As part of proactive prenatal care, all pregnant women should receive certain blood tests to detect infections and other illnesses, such as HIV, syphilis, and Hepatitis B. Talk to a health care provider about these tests.
                                        
                                        Also, anyone who has been sexually assaulted or has had a high-risk exposure to HIV should consider taking post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and getting an HIV antigen test that can detect infection sooner than standard antibody testing. PEP may prevent HIV infection after possible exposure to HIV if it is started as soon as possible within 3 days after exposure to HIV.

                              <h3>How Can HIV Testing Help You?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   About 1 in 8 people in the United States who have HIV do not know they have it. The only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Knowing your HIV status gives you powerful information to help you take steps to keep you and your partner(s) healthy:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             If you test positive, you can be connected to HIV care to start treatment with HIV medicine as soon as possible. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed can live long and healthy lives. There’s also an important prevention benefit. If you take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load, you will not transmit HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>If you test negative, you have more prevention tools available today to prevent HIV than ever before.</li>
                                        <li>
                                             If you are pregnant, you should be tested for HIV so that you can begin treatment if you're HIV-positive. If you have HIV and take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout your pregnancy and childbirth and give HIV medicine to your baby for 4 to 6 weeks after giving birth, your risk of transmitting HIV to your baby can be less than 1%. HIV medicine will protect your own health as well.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>

                                   <p>
                                        The sooner you know your status, the better. Some people with HIV have it for years before they know it. During that time, they aren’t getting the treatment they need to protect their health and prevent transmission of HIV to their sexual or needle sharing partners. That’s why CDC encourages more frequent HIV testing for individuals who might have a risk for getting HIV.

                              <h3>Is HIV Self-Testing an Option?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Yes. HIV self-testing allows people to take an HIV test and find out their result in their own home or other private location. There are two kinds:

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             A Rapid Self-Test is done entirely at home or in a private location and can produce results within 20 minutes. You can buy a rapid self-test kitExit at a pharmacy or online. The only rapid self-test currently available in the US is an oral fluid.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             A Mail-In Self-Test includes a specimen collection kit that contains supplies to collect dried blood from a fingerstick at home. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing and the results are provided by a health care provider. Mail-in self-tests can be ordered through various online merchant sites. Your health care provider can also order a mail-in self-test for you.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>

                                   <p>
                                        Check to see if the health department or other organization near you is providing rapid self-tests for a reduced cost or for free. You can call your local health departmentExit or use the HIV Services Locator to find organizations that offer HIV self-test kits near you. (Contact the organization for eligibility requirements.)
                                        <br><br>
                                        Directly purchased self-tests may not be covered by private health insurance or Medicaid. Be sure to check with your insurance provider and your health care provider about whether you can be reimbursed for tests that you purchase yourself.

                                        <strong>Note:</strong> State laws regarding self-testing vary and may limit availability. Check with your health care provider or local health department for additional testing options.

                              <h3>Should You Get Tested for HIV If You Don’t Think You’re at High Risk?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Some people who test positive for HIV were not aware of their risk. That's why CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care and more often if you do things that might increase your risk for getting HIV. (See above).
                                   <br><br>
                                   Even if you are in a monogamous relationship (both you and your partner are having sex only with each other), you should find out for sure whether you or your partner has HIV.
                              </p>

                                   You can get an HIV test at many places:

                                   <ul>

                                   As required by the Affordable Care Act, HIV screening is covered by health insurance without a co-pay. This includes most Medicaid programs. If you don’t have health insurance, some testing sites health centers, or local health departments may offer free or low-cost tests.

                              <p>
                                   There are many ways to get tested for HIV. Your HIV testing experience might differ depending on where you get tested and the types of tests offered at a particular location.
                              </p>

                              <h3>HIV Testing in a Health Care Setting or Lab</h3>
                              <p>
                                   If you take a test in a health care setting or a lab, a health care provider or lab technician will take a sample of your blood or oral fluid. If it’s a rapid test done by taking oral fluid or by pricking your finger for a few drops of blood, you may be able to wait for the results. If it’s a blood sample that goes to a lab, it can take several days for your results to be available.
                                   <br><br>
                                   Your health care provider or counselor may talk with you about your HIV risk factors, answer any questions, and discuss the next steps with you, especially if your rapid test result is positive.

                                   <ul>
                                        <li>If your test comes back negative, and you haven’t had an exposure during the window period for the test you took, you can be confident you don’t have HIV. You can take actions to prevent HIV, such as using PrEP.</li>
                                        <li>If your oral swab or finger prick test is positive, it will need to be followed up with a blood sample to confirm the results.</li>
                                        <li>If that confirmatory test result is positive, the lab will conduct follow-up tests. If you receive a positive test result, you can take medicine to treat HIV (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), which protects your health and prevents transmission to others. You may be able to start treatment the same day you get your test result.</li>
                                   </ul>

                              <p>
                                   If you have a positive HIV test result, your HIV testing site will often link you to HIV care right after diagnosis so you can get started on treatment right away. That’s because starting treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as soon as possible is the best thing you can do to stay healthy. HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in your blood to an undetectable level—a level so low that a lab test can’t detect it. People with HIV who take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong> (This is often called undetectable = untransmittable or U=U). Treatment with HIV medicine is recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of how long you’ve had the virus or how healthy you are.
                                   <br><br>
                                   There are other ways to find HIV providers and services too:

                                   HIV treatment involves taking highly effective medicines called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that work to control the virus. ART is recommended for everyone with HIV, and people with HIV should start ART as soon as possible after diagnosis, even on that same day.
                                   <br><br>
                                   People on ART take a combination of HIV medicines called an HIV treatment regimen. A person's initial HIV treatment regimen generally includes three HIV medicines from at least two different HIV drug classes that must be taken exactly as prescribed. There are several options that have two or three different HIV medicines combined into a once-daily pill. Long-acting injections of HIV medicine, given every two months, are also available if your health care provider determines that you meet certain requirements.

                                   Today, thanks to improvements in the effectiveness of treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), people with HIV who are diagnosed early and who get and stay on ART can keep the virus suppressed and live long and healthy lives. For this reason, more than half of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States and 6 territories and freely associated states are aged 50 and older. Many of them have been living with HIV for many years; others were diagnosed with HIV later in life.
