                              <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.

                                   <br><br>
                                   
                                   If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (<i>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</i>).

                                   <br><br>

                                   The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.
                                   Luckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a person’s viral load is so low that a standard lab can’t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   
                                   <br><br>

                                   In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. Learn about other ways to prevent getting or transmitting HIV.

                                   Treatment as Prevention (TasP) refers to taking HIV medicine to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. It is one of the most highly effective options for preventing HIV transmission.
                                   <br></br>
                                   People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load—a very low level of HIV in the blood—can live long and healthy lives and will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex. This is sometimes called undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
                                   <br></br>
                                   TasP works when a person with HIV takes HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and has regular follow-up care, including routine viral load tests to ensure their viral load stays undetectable.

                                   CDC recommends that everyone between the ages of 13 and 64 should get tested for HIV at least once as part of routine health care. People should get tested more often when they have had more than one sex partner or are having sex with someone whose sexual history they don’t know. Some sexually active gay and bisexual men may benefit from more frequent testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).

                                   If your last HIV test result was negative, the test was more than one year ago, and you can answer yes to any of the following questions, then you should get an HIV test as soon as possible:

                                   If you have a positive HIV test result, your HIV testing site will often link you to HIV care right after diagnosis so you can get started on treatment right away. That’s because starting treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) as soon as possible is the best thing you can do to stay healthy. HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in your blood to an undetectable level—a level so low that a lab test can’t detect it. People with HIV who take HIV medicine exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong> (This is often called undetectable = untransmittable or U=U). Treatment with HIV medicine is recommended for all people with HIV, regardless of how long you’ve had the virus or how healthy you are.

People with HIV who take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>stay healthy</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to an HIV-negative partner through sex.</strong> An undetectable viral load is a level of HIV in your blood so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it.

                                   Today, thanks to improvements in the effectiveness of treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART), people with HIV who are diagnosed early and who get and stay on ART can keep the virus suppressed and live long and healthy lives. For this reason, more than half of people with diagnosed HIV in the United States and 6 territories and freely associated states are aged 50 and older. Many of them have been living with HIV for many years; others were diagnosed with HIV later in life.
