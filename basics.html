                              <h3>What Is HIV?</h3>
                              <p>HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks cells that help the body fight infection, making a person more vulnerable to other infections and diseases. It is spread by contact with certain bodily fluids of a person with HIV, most commonly during unprotected sex (sex without a condom or HIV medicine to prevent or treat HIV), or through sharing injection drug equipment.

                                   <br><br>
                                   
                                   If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease AIDS (<i>acquired immunodeficiency syndrome</i>).

                                   <br><br>

                                   The human body can’t get rid of HIV and no effective HIV cure exists. So, once you have HIV, you have it for life.
                                   Luckily, however, effective treatment with HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) is available. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood (also called the viral load) to a very low level. This is called viral suppression. If a person’s viral load is so low that a standard lab can’t detect it, this is called having an undetectable viral load. People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   
                                   <br><br>

                                   In addition, there are effective methods to prevent getting HIV through sex or drug use, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), medicine people at risk for HIV take to prevent getting HIV from sex or injection drug use, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), HIV medicine taken within 72 hours after a possible exposure to prevent the virus from taking hold. Learn about other ways to prevent getting or transmitting HIV.</p>
                              
                              <h3>What Is AIDS?</h3>
                              <p>AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection that occurs when the body’s immune system is badly damaged because of the virus.

                                   <br><br>

                                   In the U.S., most people with HIV do not develop AIDS because taking HIV medicine as prescribed stops the progression of the disease.
                                   <br><br>
                                   A person with HIV is considered to have progressed to AIDS when:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             the number of their CD4 cells falls below 200 cells per cubic millimeter of blood (200 cells/mm3). (In someone with a healthy immune system, CD4 counts are between 500 and 1,600 cells/mm3.) OR
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             they develop one or more opportunistic infections regardless of their CD4 count.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>
                                   <p>
                                        Without HIV medicine, people with AIDS typically survive about 3 years. Once someone has a dangerous opportunistic illness, life expectancy without treatment falls to about 1 year. HIV medicine can still help people at this stage of HIV infection, and it can even be lifesaving. But people who start HIV medicine soon after they get HIV experience more benefits—that's why HIV testing is so important.

                              <h3>How Do I Know If I Have HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   <strong>The only way to know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested.</strong> Testing is relatively simple. You can ask your health care provider for an HIV test. Many medical clinics, substance abuse programs, community health centers, and hospitals offer them too. If you test positive, you can be connected to HIV care to start treatment as soon as possible. If you test negative, you have the information you need to take steps to prevent getting HIV in the future.
                                   <br><br>
                                   To find an HIV testing location near you, use the HIV Services Locator.
                                   <br><br>
                                   <strong>HIV self-testing is also an option.</strong> Self-testing allows people to take an HIV test and find out their result in their own home or other private location. With an HIV self-test, you can get your test results within 20 minutes. You can buy an HIV self-test kit at a pharmacy or online. Some health departments or community-based organizations also provide HIV self-test kits for a reduced cost or for free. You can call your local health department or use the HIV Testing and Care Services Locator to find organizations that offer HIV self-test kits near you. (Contact the organization for eligibility requirements.)
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Do You Get or Transmit HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   You can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain body fluids from a person with HIV who has a detectable viral load. These fluids are:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>Blood</li>
                                        <li>Semen (cum) and pre-seminal fluid (pre-cum)</li>
                                        <li>Rectal fluids</li>
                                        <li>Vaginal fluids</li>
                                        <li>Breast milk</li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>
                                   <p>
                                        For transmission to occur, the HIV in these fluids must get into the bloodstream of an HIV-negative person through a mucous membrane (found in the rectum, vagina, mouth, or tip of the penis), through open cuts or sores, or by direct injection (from a needle or syringe).
                                        <br><br>
                                        People with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>
                                   </p>                                   
                              </p>

                              <h3>How Is HIV Spread from Person to Person?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   HIV can only be spread through specific activities. In the United States, the most common ways are:
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Does HIV Viral Load Affect Getting or Transmitting HIV?</strong> without using a condom the right way every time or taking medicines to prevent or treat HIV. Anal sex is riskier than vaginal sex for HIV transmission. Learn more about the HIV risk associated with specific sexual activities.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Sharing injection drug equipment, such as needles, syringes, or other drug injection equipment (“works”)</strong> with someone who has HIV because these items may have blood in them, and blood can carry HIV. People who inject hormones, silicone, or steroids can also get or transmit HIV by sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment. Learn more about HIV and injection drug use.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>

                                   <p>Less common ways are:</p>
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>An HIV-positive person transmitting HIV to their baby during pregnancy, birth, or breastfeeding.</strong> However, the use of HIV medicines and other strategies have helped lower the risk of perinatal transmission of HIV to less than 1% in the United States. Learn more.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Being exposed to HIV through a needlestick or sharps injury.</strong> This is a risk mainly for health care workers. The risk is very low.
                                        </li>
                                   </ul>
                                   <br>

                                   <p>HIV is spread only in extremely rare cases by:</p>
                                   <ul>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Having oral sex.</strong> Oral sex carries little to no risk for getting or transmitting HIV. Theoretically, it is possible if an HIV-positive man ejaculates in his partner’s mouth during oral sex. Factors that may increase the risk of transmitting HIV through oral sex are oral ulcers, bleeding gums, genital sores, and the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which may or may not be visible. However, the risk is still extremely low, and much lower than with anal or vaginal sex.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Receiving blood transfusions, blood products, or organ/tissue transplants that are contaminated with HIV.</strong> The risk is extremely small these days because of rigorous testing of the U.S. blood supply and donated organs and tissues. (And you can’t get HIV from donating blood. Blood collection procedures are highly regular and very safe.)
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                             <strong>Being bitten by a person with HIV.</strong> Each of the very small number of documented cases has involved severe trauma with extensive tissue damage and the presence of blood. This rare transmission can occur through contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and blood or body fluids from a person who has HIV. There is no risk of transmission if the skin is not broken. There are no documented cases of HIV being transmitted through spitting as HIV is not transmitted through saliva.

                                             <strong>Eating food that has been pre-chewed by a person with HIV.</strong> The only known cases are among infants. HIV transmission can occur when the blood from an HIV-positive caregiver’s mouth mixes with food while chewing and an infant eats it. However,  you can’t get HIV by consuming food handled by someone with HIV.
                                        </li>

                              <h3>Does HIV Viral Load Affect Getting or Transmitting HIV?</h3>
                              <p>
                                   Yes. Viral load is the amount of HIV in the blood of someone who has HIV. If taken as prescribed, HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) can reduce a person's HIV viral load very low level, which keeps the immune system working and prevents illness. This is called <strong>viral suppression</strong>, defined as having less than 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood.
                                   <br><br>
                                   HIV medicine can also make the viral load so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. This is called having an <strong>undetectable level viral load.</strong> Almost everyone who takes HIV medicine as prescribed can achieve an undetectable viral load, usually within 6 months after starting treatment.

                                   As noted above, people with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load can <strong>live long and healthy lives</strong> and <strong>will not transmit HIV to their HIV-negative partners through sex.</strong>

                                   HIV medicine is a powerful tool for preventing sexual transmission of HIV. But it works only if the HIV-positive partner gets and keeps an undetectable viral load. Not everyone taking HIV medicine has an undetectable viral load. To stay undetectable, people with HIV must take HIV medicine as prescribed and visit their health care provider regularly to get a viral load test.
